About
-----

eXm is a set of industrial textures derivated from the eX texture set.

This texture set is a work in progress derivation from the eX texture set for the [Unvanquished](https://unvanquished.net) game project.

This texture set is meant to be used with a level editor like [NetRadiant](https://netradiant.gitlab.io/).

Visit the [Unvanquished website](https://unvanquished.net/) for more information about the game itself.
